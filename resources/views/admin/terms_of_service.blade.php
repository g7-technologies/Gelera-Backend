        <h4>SERVICES</h4>
        <p><b>Gelera Mining App is a non-custodial wallet software, for digital assets such as Gelera
        currency, (“Digital Assets”), meaning you are solely in control of and responsible for
        your Digital Assets and private keys, and accordingly you can authorize transactions
        from your wallet address. You expressly acknowledge and agree that as Gelera Mining
        App is a non-custodial wallet software, you are solely responsible for your activity
        and any risk of loss at all times.</b></p>

        <h4>Wallet Address, Private Key, and Backup Capabilities</h4>
        <p>An encrypted backup of certain information associated with your wallet can be stored on
        eligible devices. The private key is associated with the wallet address and, together, they
        can be used to authorize the transfer of Digital Assets to and from that wallet address. You
        are solely responsible for the retention and security of your private key and any mnemonic
        phrase (“Secret Phrase”) associated with your wallet. You must keep your wallet address,
        Secret Phrase, and private key access information secure. It is very important that you
        backup your private keys, backup phrases or passwords. Failure to do so may result in the
        loss of control of Digital Assets associated with your wallet. You acknowledge and agree that
        we do not receive or store your wallet password, encrypted private key, unencrypted private
        key, or Secret Phrase associated with your wallet. We cannot generate a new password for
        your wallet if you fail to remember your original password. If you have not safely stored a
        backup of any wallet address and private key pairs maintained in your wallet, you accept and
        acknowledge that any Digital Assets you have associated with such wallet address will
        become inaccessible. Accordingly, we shall have no responsibility or liability whatsoever in
        the event you are unable to access your wallet for any reason including without limitation
        your failure to keep your wallet address, Secret Phrase and private key information secure.</p>

        <h4>Buy Digital Assets with Supported Credit or Debit Cards</h4>
        <p>If you use Gelera Mining App to purchase Digital Assets with your credit or debit card, a third
        party will convert your chosen amount into the applicable Digital Asset and credit it to your
        wallet. You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gelera Mining App is not responsible for your
            use of such third party service and shall have no liability whatsoever in connection with your
            use of such service;</li>
            <li>you will be subject to any terms and conditions imposed by the
            relevant third party service provider;</li>
            <li>Gelera Mining App has no ability to change,
            withdraw or cancel any conversion requests you place;</li>
            <li>Gelera Mining App is not
            responsible for any exchange rates offered by the relevant third party service provider(s);
            and </li>
            <li>Gelera Mining App is not responsible for any fees charged by the relevant third party
            service provider(s) or your bank or credit card issuer(s).</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Digital Asset Transactions</h4>
        <p>In order for all proposed Digital Asset transactions to be completed, they must be confirmed
        and recorded in the Digital Asset’s associated public blockchain. Such networks are
        decentralized, peer-to-peer networks supported by independent third parties, which we do
        not own, control, or operate. We have no control over the blockchain networks and,
        therefore, cannot and do not ensure that any transaction details that you submit via our
        Services will be confirmed and processed. By using Gelera Mining App, you acknowledge
        and agree that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>we do not have the ability to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction;</li>
            <li>the transaction details you submit may not be completed, or may be substantially
            delayed, by the applicable blockchain networks;</li>
            <li>we do not store, send, or receive Digital Assets; and </li>
            <li>any transfer that occurs in relation to any Digital Asset occurs on the
            relevant blockchain network and not on a network owned by us and therefore we do not
            guarantee the transfer of title or right in any Digital Asset.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Accuracy of Information Provided by User</h4>
        <p>You represent and warrant that any information you provide via the Services is accurate and
        complete. You accept and acknowledge that we are not responsible for any errors or
        omissions that you make in connection with any Digital Asset transaction initiated via the
        Services. We strongly encourage you to review your transaction details carefully before
        attempting to transfer a Digital Asset.</p>

        <h4>Push Notifications</h4>
        <p>You may agree to receive push notifications from Gelera Mining App that will alert you when
        blockchain networks supported by Gelera Mining App are congested and when transactions
        involving your wallet have been completed. If you would like to receive push notifications,
        you must opt in to the service by accessing “Settings” and enabling “Push Notifications”.</p>

        <h4>Payment and Fees</h4>
        <p>Fees applicable to the Services or any component of the Services, if any, shall be set forth at
        geleracurrency.com and/or the Gelera Mining App mobile application.</p>

        <h4>Transaction Fees</h4>
        <p>There may be transaction fees (e.g. mining fees) associated with your virtual currency
        transactions that are required by the virtual currency system or blockchain network that you
        engage with. You must ensure that you have an adequate balance in your wallet and/or
        “gas” to complete transactions before initiating a transaction. You acknowledge and agree
        that we will not be liable for any failed transactions or losses you incur due to incorrectly set
        transaction fees (i.e. too low or too high) or due to insufficient funds or gas associated with
        your wallet address. You further acknowledge and agree that we do not have access to your
        or anyone else’s transactions.</p>

        <h4>Taxes</h4>
        <p>It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions that you
        have submitted transaction details for via the Services, and it is your responsibility to report
        and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that we are not
        responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your transactions or for collecting,
        reporting, withholding, or remitting any taxes arising from any Digital Asset-related
        transactions.</p>

        <h4>THIRD PARTY SERVICES AND CONTENT</h4>
        <p>In no event shall a description or reference to a third party’s product or service (including, but
        not limited to, providing a description or reference via hyperlink) be construed as an
        endorsement or promotion of such third party products or services by us. We retain the
        exclusive right to add to, modify, or cancel the availability of any Third Party Service. You
        may agree to receive push notifications from Third Party Content providers. In order to
        receive push notifications, you must opt in to the service. Push notifications will not be
        automatically enabled on your device for Third Party Content. We do not control, endorse, or
        adopt any Third Party Content shared through push notifications, and will have no
        responsibility for Third Party Content including, but not limited to, token availability and/or
        sales. If, to the extent permitted by Gelera Mining App, you grant express permission to a
        third party to access or connect to your Gelera Mining App account, either through the third
        party’s product or service or through Gelera Mining App, you acknowledge that granting
        permission to a third party to take specific actions on your behalf does not relieve you of any
        of your responsibilities under these Terms. You are fully responsible for all acts or omissions
        of any third party with access to your wallet.</p>

        <h4 class="mb-2">INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h4>

        <h4>License</h4>

        and the parties’ relationship as if you signed these Terms in California, without regard to
        Croatia’s conflicts of laws rules. If any provisions of these Terms are inconsistent with any
        applicable law, those provisions will be superseded or modified only to the extent such
        provisions are inconsistent. The parties agree to submit to the federal or state courts in
        Croatia for exclusive jurisdiction of any dispute arising out of or related to your use of the
        Services or your breach of these Terms. You waive any objection based on lack of personal
        jurisdiction, place of residence, improper venue, or forum non conveniens in any such action.</p>

        <h4>NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL USERS</h4>
        <p>If you are a user accessing or using our Services from a region with laws or regulations

        our Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p>In the event of termination concerning your license to use Gelera Mining App, your
        obligations under this Agreement will still continue. Your access to the funds in your Wallet
        after termination will depend on your access to your backup of your Wallet address and
        private key.</p>

        <h4>DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICES</h4>
        <p>We may, in our sole discretion and without cost to you, with or without prior notice, and at
        any time, modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any portion of our Services. You
        are solely responsible for storing outside of the Services a backup of any wallet address and
        private key pair that you maintain in your wallet. Maintaining an external backup of any wallet
        address and private key pairs associated with your wallet will allow you to access the
        blockchain network upon which your wallet is secured. Such a backup will allow you to fully
        restore your wallet at any time without cost or loss of your Digital Assets. If you do not
        maintain a backup of your wallet data outside of the Services, you will not be able to access
        the Digital Assets associated with your wallet. Gelera Mining App shall not be held
        responsible or liable for any loss of Digital Assets in the event that we discontinue all or any
        part of the Services.</p>

        right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized
        representative of us. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the exercise by either
        party of any of its remedies under this Agreement will be without prejudice to its other
        remedies under this Agreement or otherwise.</p>

        <h4>SEVERABILITY</h4>
        <p>If it turns out that any part of this Agreement is invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable,
        that term will be deemed severable and limited or eliminated to the minimum extent
        necessary. The limitation or elimination of the term shall not affect or impair the validity or
        enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause or provision or any other terms,
        clauses or provisions of these Terms.</p>

        <p>The parties agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from this Agreement or your use of the

        BY JURY. The parties agree that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>any arbitration will occur in Zagreb, Croatia; and</li>

            of Croatian Arbitration Association for arbitration of consumer-related disputes, in the
            Croatian language, and with limited discovery.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At your request, hearings may be conducted
        in person or by telephone and the arbitrator may provide for submitting and determining
        motions on briefs, without oral hearings. Other than class procedures and remedies
        discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise
        be available to a court or other tribunal. <b>THE PREVAILING PARTY IN ANY ACTION OR
        PROCEEDING TO ENFORCE THESE TERMS SHALL BE ENTITLED TO COSTS AND
        ATTORNEYS' FEES. THE ARBITRAL DECISION MAY BE ENFORCED IN ANY COURT.
        WHETHER THE DISPUTE IS HEARD IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT, YOU AND
